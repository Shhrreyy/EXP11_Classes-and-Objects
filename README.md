# ðŸ§© EXP-11: Classes and Objects in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To implement and understand the concept of **classes and objects** in C++ by solving real-world problems such as calculator operations, geometric calculations, and information storage.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory

- **Class**  
  A user-defined data type in C++ that groups variables (data members) and functions (member functions) into a single unit.  

- **Object**  
  An instance of a class. Each object has its own copy of data members but shares the classâ€™s functions.  

- **Access Specifiers**  
  - **Public** â€“ Members accessible outside the class.  
  - **Private** â€“ Members accessible only inside the class.  
  - **Protected** â€“ Members accessible within class and derived classes.  

- **Advantages of Classes and Objects**  
  - Data abstraction  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Code reusability  
  - Real-world modeling

## ðŸ§® Algorithms / Steps

### 1. **Bike Information (`Bike_info.cpp`)**
- Define a class `Bike` with attributes like model, brand, and price.  
- Use member functions to input and display bike information.  
- Create objects to represent different bikes.  

### 2. **Calculator (`Calculator.cpp`)**
- Define a class `Calculator` with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Take user input for numbers and operation choice.  
- Perform the operation using member functions and display result.  

### 3. **Multiple Objects (`Multiple_objects.cpp`)**
- Define a class with some attributes.  
- Create multiple objects to show that each object has its own separate data.  

### 4. **Rectangle Area (`RecatanglÐµ_area.cpp`)**
- Define a class `Rectangle` with length and breadth as members.  
- Use a function to calculate area = `length Ã— breadth`.  
- Display result.  

### 5. **Cube Volume using Public & Private Members (`cubevolume_publicpvt.cpp`)**
- Define a class with side length as a private member.  
- Provide public functions to set value and calculate cube volume.  

### 6. **Cube Volume Inside & Outside Definition (`volm_cube_insideoutside.cpp`)**
- Define cube volume function inside the class (inline) and outside using scope resolution operator.  
- Show how both approaches work with object creation.

## âœ… Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the **core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as data encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity.  
By using classes and objects, real-world entities like bikes, calculators, and shapes can be effectively modeled in C++.
